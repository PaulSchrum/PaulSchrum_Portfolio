<h2>Statement</h2>
<p>The purpose of getting a <a href="https://online.geospatial.ncsu.edu/programs/master-of-geospatial-information-science-technology/">Master's in Geospatial Information Information Technology</a> in my early 50's is that I am ready to change my career. I keep coming up with ideas on new ways to do things in the field of Engineering, Computational Geometry, and GIS. I realized that the best way for me to develop these ideas is to change my career to academia.</p>
<p>Inspired by a TED Talk by Lucy Kellaway (<a href="https://youtu.be/LilaqTaQ6ss?t=2m56s">I'm becoming a teacher at 58 - this is why you should too</a>), I got a <a href="https://www.johnhancockinsurance.com/life/life-expectancy-tool.aspx">Web App</a> to compute my life expectancy, and it is 89. So I think I have about 30 good years of productive work left in my life. I want to use that time to get some interesting things accomplished.</p>
